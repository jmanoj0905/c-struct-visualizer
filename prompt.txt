Make sure the autolayout never results in overlapping of 2 struct instances .Remove the builtin alerts and make alerts ups that fit the theme. and in the instance card remove the dustbin icon and make it appear only on hover. update the clean up layout button to fit the theme. update the pop up menus too. There are 4 buttons under the {switch to selection, undo, redo} buttons. remove those 4 unused buttons which are zoom in zoom out and fit to window and one more. move to somewhere appropreate and not hidden. Make sure the struct instance color in the workspace is consistent with the theme in the sidebar and vice verca.
